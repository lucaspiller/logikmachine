# Schedules

Schedules are block-local triggers. Fixed schedules use a local time, interval
schedules use a UTC phase, and astronomical schedules use a solar event plus a
signed offset. `weekdays` is the only calendar condition in a schedule rule.

An astronomical schedule is not clamped to an `earliest` or `latest` time. Use
separate schedules when an automation needs separate trigger times, and use
Lua for conditions on the captured solar values.

For example, trigger 15 minutes before sunset but emit only when the raw local
sunset is no later than 21:15:

```toml
[[blocks.schedules]]
name = "sunset_check"
enabled = true
kind = "astronomical"
anchor = "sunset"
offset = "-15m"
```

```lua
function handle(event, input, meta, state, ctx)
    if event.type == "schedule"
        and event.schedule == "sunset_check"
        and ctx.sun.sunset <= "21:15" then
        return { outputs = { test_light = true } }
    end
end
```

`DateTimeValue` ordering against canonical local-time strings in `HH:MM` or
`HH:MM:SS` form works on either side of the operator. It compares only the
local hour, minute, and second, ignoring the date;
`DateTimeValue`-to-`DateTimeValue` comparisons keep their instant semantics. An
unavailable value compares false. Malformed time strings produce a contained
Lua runtime error.

For example, a morning condition can use `ctx.now < "06:00"`. There is no
broad time-construction API.
